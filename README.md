Detecting the molecular type of breast cancer is critical to identify the treatment method specific to its subgroup. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and quadruple-negative breast cancer (QNBC) are two breast cancer subgroups. This project presents an application of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using
Efficient Net B1 architecture as feature extractor to classify TNBC and QNBC pathology scans.
